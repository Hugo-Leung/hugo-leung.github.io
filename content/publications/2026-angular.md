We present experimental results on the angular distributions of Drell-Yan muons produced by a 120 GeV/$c$ proton beam interacting with liquid hydrogen and deuterium targets. The dimuon angular distributions in both polar ($θ$) and azimuthal ($ϕ$) angles in the Collins-Soper frame are measured within the kinematic range of $4.5 < m_{μμ} < 10\\ \\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, $0.19 < p_T < 2.24\\ \\mathrm{GeV}/c$, and $0 < x_F < 0.95$. Unlike the results of a previous proton-induced Drell-Yan experiment at a higher energy, the data reveal a pronounced $\\cos 2ϕ$ modulation in the angular distributions. Comparison with perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions shows statistically significant deviations, with p-values of 3.5% for the $p+p$ and 1.5% for the $p+d$ Drell-Yan processes. These results suggest the presence of nonperturbative QCD contributions.
