The Fermilab E906/SeaQuest collaboration performed measurements of the Drell-Yan process using
120 GeV proton beams bombarding liquid hydrogen and liquid deuterium targets.
A combined analysis of all collected data was performed to obtain the final results for the $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ Drell-Yan cross
section ratio covering the kinematic region of $0.13 < x < 0.45$.
The $x$-dependencies of $\bar{d}\left(x\right) / \bar{u}\left(x\right)$ and $\bar{d}\left(x\right) - \bar{u}\left(x\right)$
are extracted from these cross section ratios.
It is found that $\bar{d}\left(x\right)$ is greater than $\bar{u}\left(x\right)$ over the entire measured $x$
range, with improved statistical accuracy compared to previous measurements.
The new results on $\bar{d}\left(x\right) / \bar{u}\left(x\right)$ and $\bar{d}\left(x\right) - \bar{u}\left(x\right)$
are compared to various parton distribution functions and theoretical calculations.
